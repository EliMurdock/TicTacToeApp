# Tic Tac Toe Overview (C++)

This is my first C++ project, created to test my ability to learn and code in a new language. 
There are several pieces of software in this repository, and all of them are Tic Tac Toe. The 
first project was "BasicTic.cpp" a rudimentary form of Tic Tac Toe played in the console. It was 
built loosely following Youtube tutorial, with several modifications of my own. Then after
hurs of research on GUIs, I created my own GUI with te simplest framework I could find to make 
a small Tic Tac Toe App. I wrote the tougher program to test my limits in C++.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

After trying Code::Blocks, I switched to using Visual Studio Code with the C++ extension and 
Code Runner extension. I also installed MingGW and added it to PATH for VSCode to work.

It is all coded in C++ with the windows.h library for the gui and the iostream library for 
bug-testing.


# Useful Websites

The sites I used most often for research and development are as follows:

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Youtube](www.youtube.com)
- [StackOverflow](stackoverflow.com)
- [CPlusPlus](cplusplus.com)
- [Geeks for Geeks](www.geeksforgeeks.org)
- [Proware Tech](www.prowaretech.com)
- [Programiz](www.programiz.com)
- [Sourceforge](sourceforge.net)


# Future Work

- A restart button would be a nice quality of life change.
- Following that, a scoreboard could be added.
- A randomizer to pick who goes first.
